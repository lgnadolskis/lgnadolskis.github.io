Week 7: July 13 to July 17

It was required to do more modifications than I expected on the setup of the device.
Turns out that as it is said on the device the intel real sense does not work on the Raspberry Pi 3b+ so I needed to get a Raspberry Pi 4b with 4GB for the project.
The camera took a couple of days to arrive so this week I spent mostly on thinking about what to do once the camera has arrived.
There is a problem with the way that AlwaysAI returns the results.
It is done on a streamer which it won’t be very useful for the project.
I am adapting the code in a way that instead of returning on the streamer it does so on the terminal.

Let me explain. Little more about the streamer.

Once the camera is running, the user needs to go to the browser and access an specific URL which is provided.
On that URL it may be found the video that the camera is currently streaming and the information being output by the code.
I tested with the realTime_objectDetector, in which the output was the prediction label and the certainty which the code classified the image.
I haven’t had the chance to see what the result of the depth camera is.
Still finishing up gathering the new devices.
