Week 6: July 6 to July 10

After spending some time with the Raspberry Pi and the 8 MP camera I started looking more into the alwaysAI set of pre-trained programs and there are some options that are looking interesting.
After attending a workshop hosted by AlwaysAI on depth cameras I can see new possibilities to make the project faster and spend more time in testing.
The workshop may be found at:

Here there is an explanation of using one of the pretrained codes realSense_objectDetector to obtain the distance between the camera and the object.
The intel real Sense d 435 is a depth camera and as such it makes easier to detect the distance to any framed object.
Because AlwaysAI has built in classification models it is possible to have as an output the label of the object and its distance.
I will work now on getting the camera for next week, but this will probably take some time.
