Week 9: July 27 to July 31

It was decided to use the beeps.
Using the speaker although it might give more information it is harder and a little unnecessary for this project.
I bought a 5v active buzzer for beeps since I found that to be the most useful option.
The other issue that the device presented to be useful was mobility. This was solved with the hat with 2 18650 batteries.
Giving energy for a little over one hour they were very good, their only issue is the weight.
Something to be fixed in future versions, however this module is the only one I found in short noticed to be bought.
The volume of the beep is very loud as well, so I got a 10k potentiometer to control the current and therefore the volume.
This proved to be very efficient.
Concluding that the device is ready, I ran more testing on it using the beep, the computer now is only being used to start the code.
After more measures with the tape I found the distances of the beep to be similar to the oneâ€™s provided by the camera, only with an estimated 2 to 3 seconds delay to start beeping.
This is not very significant for the project in mind.
With that concluded I intend to start writing the final paper next week.
