week of june 22 to june 26.

This week I was able to find a solution for one of the two main parts of week 3.
I believe that we could use the platform created by always ai to develop the people detection part of the code.
More informations about this can be found at:

Using their realTime object detection code we can potentially deploy this to arespberry pi and use it to detect in realTime whenever a person is identifyed.
For the distance parts I am working in two different ideas.
1. Disparity maps. Using them we could identify the distance between object A to object B and scaling that treat object A as the camera and B as the person.
2. We could also use the idea of bounding boxes to determine a ratio between the distance that the person is and the area of the bounding box. With a simple formula we could derive a system to identify the distance in meters.
