week of june 29 to july 3.

I was able to buy one raspberry pi 3b+ and a camera of 8 mp for training and deploying.
This week was mainly spent on setting up the raspberry pi.
Also I ran more tests on the realTime ojbect ditection idea and start thinking more about using bounding boxes areas to determine the distanc eto an object.
However I was able to read more indepth the papers on disparity maps ad it is still an intersting idea.
Thinking about ways to combine both.
