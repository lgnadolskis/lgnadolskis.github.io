Week 10: August 3rd to august 7th

During this week I started writing the final report.
Going through the first versions and fixing whatever my mentor pointed.
I have a way of writing that is not very formal, therefore, most of the week was dedicated on me learning the proper academic way of writing a technical report.
Usually when I write reports at the university I have a little more time, so writing this one in two weeks was an experience, but quite valid for the future.
