Week 5: June 29 To July 3rd

I was able to buy one raspberry pi 3b+ and a camera of 8 MP for training and deploying.
This week was mainly spent on setting up the raspberry pi.
Also I ran more tests on the Realtime object detection idea and start thinking more about using bounding boxes areas to determine the distance to an object.
However I was able to read more in-depth the papers on disparity maps ad it is still an interesting idea.
Thinking about ways to combine both.
