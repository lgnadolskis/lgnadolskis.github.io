Week 1: June 1 to June 5

On the first week of the DREU summer 2020 project me and my mentor traced a plan for the upcoming weeks. Starting with the literature review.

After that I started to learn a little more in-depth how to use different databases such as ACM and IEEE.
ON that process I also gathered different papers that I thought relevant for the work we proposed to do.
I analyzed and wrote a short description of different papers.
