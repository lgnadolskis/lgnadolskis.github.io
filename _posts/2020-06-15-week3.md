Week3: June 15 to June 19

The third week was mainly dedicated on finishing up the literature review, at least for now.
Also I started looking for ways to implement the ideas in practice.
There are two main challenges.
1. Identifying when the image contains a person.
2. Identifying the distance from the camera to the person.
For the first step I am considering using a simple object detection model to identify people and train that over a large dataset.
