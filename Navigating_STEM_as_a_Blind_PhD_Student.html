STEM as a Blind PhD Student: A Personal Journey</h1>
<p>Lately, I’ve been facing the reality of what it means to be a blind
PhD student in STEM. It’s tough—books are inaccessible, technologies are
outdated, and there’s not much support out there. All of this adds up to
a massive cognitive overload. But over time, I’ve come up with some
strategies to handle these challenges. Since I think they could help
other blind or low-vision folks, I’ve decided to share them. Today, I
want to talk about how I make a document accessible, specifically an
ordinary differential equations (ODE) textbook.</p>
<h2 id="the-accessibility-challenge">The Accessibility Challenge</h2>
<p>My first step was to ask the university’s disability services for the
textbook in Braille. But when I saw how huge the Braille version was, I
knew I had to try something else. That’s when I switched to XML.</p>
<p><strong>Why XML?</strong><br />
In my experience, XML files work better with screen readers like <a
href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/">JAWS</a>
and <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA</a> in Word compared to
regular DOCX files. I’d used this method before, and it was usually
quicker and smoother. This time, though, I hit a major roadblock:
matrices.</p>
<p>JAWS and NVDA just don’t handle matrices well. Navigating through
each one takes forever. To work around this, I converted the XML to DOCX
using Word’s built-in option. The conversion went fine, but the matrix
issue stuck around.</p>
<p>On top of that, my screen readers started lagging badly when I tried
to read the document. Maybe it was the sheer number of matrices, or
maybe it’s just how screen readers handle these files—but either way, it
made reading the textbook almost impossible.</p>
<h2 id="turning-to-braille">Turning to Braille</h2>
<p>For a while, my <a
href="https://hims-inc.com/product/braille-sense-6/">HIMS-6 Braille
display</a> saved the day. Plugging it into my computer made reading
more manageable, though matrices were still a pain. I had to interact
with each one individually, which, for an ODE textbook, is no small
task.</p>
<p>Next, I tried converting the file with <a
href="https://www.duxburysystems.com/">Duxbury</a> and embossing it in
Braille. Unfortunately, this was even more frustrating. Duxbury
struggled with some math symbols and messed up the formatting of the
matrices.</p>
<p>Then things got worse—my Braille display started acting up,
repeatedly flashing “top panel locked” and “unlocked.” After talking to
HIMS support, I found out I’d have to send it in for repairs.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-drawing-board">Back to the Drawing Board</h2>
<p>With my Braille display out of commission, I was left with a document
my screen readers couldn’t handle, Duxbury struggling with conversions,
and no real backup plan. So, I went back to my old process for making
PDFs accessible:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Get the PDF</strong>: Either download it or scan a physical
copy at the highest resolution possible.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Run it Through OCR</strong>: Convert the PDF into a more
accessible format like XML, DOCX, TeX, or HTML. My go-to OCR tools are:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.abbyy.com/en-us/finereader/">Abbyy
FineReader</a><br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://mathpix.com/">MathPix</a><br />
</li>
<li><a
href="https://www.inftyproject.org/en/software.html">InftyReader</a><br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Check the Output</strong>: If the document is readable in
one of these formats, great. If not, run it through Duxbury and either
emboss it or use a Braille display.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-problems">The Problems</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>OCR Isn’t Perfect</strong>: Especially with math-heavy
content, OCR tools can’t always be trusted to get everything
right.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Duxbury’s Limitations</strong>: While it’s the best Braille
conversion software out there, it struggles with more complex math
symbols and often loses the spatial organization of formulas.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Time and Cost</strong>: This process takes forever, and the
software and devices involved aren’t cheap. Even after all that effort,
it doesn’t always work.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only way I can guarantee accuracy is by asking a sighted
colleague to compare the original document with the converted one. But
relying on others isn’t ideal and highlights the limits of today’s
accessibility tools.</p>
<h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>All of this could be avoided if publishers made their digital books
fully accessible to screen readers. I’d gladly pay for a properly
formatted, accessible version of the textbook. Unfortunately, that’s
just not an option right now.</p>
<p>This problem is even worse for PhD students. If a book or paper is
assigned for a class, the university has to provide an accessible
version. But if you need it for your research or thesis, it doesn’t
count as class material. So, you’re stuck in this frustrating PhD
limbo.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>I haven’t even gotten into the nightmare of dealing with graphs
yet—that’s a post for another day. Spoiler alert: it’s going to be even
longer than this one.</p>
